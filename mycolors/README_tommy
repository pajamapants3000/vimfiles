These colorschemes are meant to override the standard ones that typically
are meant for gvim. They are obtained from CSApprox Snapshot, the outputs of
which can be found in the CSApprox subfolder. These color schemes are the
concatenation of the originals and the ones obtained by CSApprox.
An if statement is used to determine which to execute. I tried doing
this with separate files for the two versions, but the colorschemes
could not seem to launch another colorscheme file successfully.
This approach seems to work very well. It may be worth figuring out later,
though, how to keep the csa and originals in separate files and still
launch the desired version automatically.
